# POP - Evolutionary algorithm for kids with cookies problem

We had to solve the problem:

The teacher wants to give away cookies to children. The children sit in line and each one has some grade (a grade is a natural number). The teacher wants to give at least one cookie to each child. If two kids sit with each other, and one of them has a higher grade than the other, the kid with a higher grade has to get more cookies than the other with a lower grade.
